<p id="one-two"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a beautiful Sunday morning in downtown Toronto when I, a noob first-year student, was headed to my very first StartAI<sup class="gray"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Conference. I was happy enough with my free invitation to the event, given that I was a member of the hosting team, which&nbsp; provided me with breakfast and lunch (trust me, those are key aspects of every broke-student life). The introductory remarks were followed by companies and researchers presenting their ideas, though it was evident that everyone in the room was anxiously waiting for the main attraction of the day: keynote speaker Geoffrey Hinton<sup class="gray"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the &ldquo;introductory&rdquo; presentations (all fantastic, by the way) we had a one-hour lunch break where we could network and meet the sponsor companies. At around T-20 minutes to Hinton&rsquo;s presentation, expectations started to rise and I huddled around a group of friends that were in charge of checking-in people to the event. We were briefly talking about some of the companies at the event when I noticed an old figure coming in from the front door. He passed by us unnoticed and went to get his coffee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Is that him?&rdquo; I asked a friend beside me, to which he replied:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The one and only.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked lost, but hey&hellip; it is Geff Hinton. A couple minutes later he starts to hurry back in our direction, to which I was quite surprised. He seems to get closer and closer, and I remember thinking &ldquo;there is no way he is going to talk to me, there is no way&rdquo;. To my surprise, he looks up and asks me: &ldquo;Where is the male room?&rdquo; First, I had to realize the fact that he was actually talking to me&hellip; Geoffrey Hinton was talking to me. After wrapping my head around the fact that the, so called, &ldquo;God of AI&rdquo; just came talk to me, my mind was completely static.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to make the most out of this moment&hellip; How can I stand out to him? How can he remember me? But seeing his desperation (to get to the washroom as quick as possible, I supposed), I realized my best move was to really just show him where the washroom was. I tried my best to be as precise and polite as I could be, to give the most perfect washroom directions someone on earth has ever given, and let him off to his pipi journey. I was proud of my accomplishment, I already felt a part of Geff&rsquo;s life, it was love at first sight. I imagined myself already in his lab, helping him do his research&hellip; I felt we were best friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A couple minutes later, while I was bragging about talking to the man, I see his figure walking back in the same hurry towards us again. That is when my imagination went off&hellip; &ldquo;Oh my god, he is going to talk to me about how my instructions were so precise and accurate, that he could envision my research abilities just from the speech I gave him about washroom directions.&rdquo; I was getting prepared for yet another round of communication between me and my BFF Geff... Perhaps an offer to work with him based on the skills he clearly saw in me. He approaches me with a certain desperation and says, &ldquo;Sir, that washroom was locked.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My world fell apart, all my fantasies were destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it wasn&rsquo;t time to cry over spilt milk, I had to rise to that circumstance and solve his problem like a MAN. That is when a buddy of mine, hearing the conversation, steps in and directs him to a different washroom. Given the time that he took in there, I assumed that one wasn&rsquo;t locked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was also during that time that I found out about a very interesting fact about Mr. Hinton: he is actually unable to sit down due to a back problem. That left me wondering for a couple of minutes how he addresses his most humane necessities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, regardless of the rather comic situation created, I at least get to say that I personally met Geoffrey Hinton. When all the emotions had faded, we made our way into the theater to witness his keynote presentation.</span></p>
<p id="three"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the very beginning he seemed very approachable and kind. He opened two slide-shows on the screen and even gave us the opportunity to vote for the one we would like him to present about. Only to reveal afterwards that he just asked for the fun of it and that he was going to present the one he liked the most either way. The presentation was brilliant as expected... or it would have been if I actually understood what he was talking about. He seemed to be talking gibberish to me<sup class="gray"><a href="#3">3</a></sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At one point he asked the crowd: &ldquo;Who here knows about the Backpropagation Algorithm?&rdquo;, to which I happily raised my hand (thanks <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/" target="_blank">Grant Sanderson</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">!), for him to reply &ldquo;Well, those of you who don&rsquo;t&hellip; You are out of luck today.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I did understand most (okay, maybe </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">some</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">) parts of his presentation, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, and I really enjoyed what I understood. But I could really notice how ahead of the curve a person like he really is. Nonetheless, although I caught myself zoning out a couple times, I really enjoyed witnessing a great mind like Geoffrey&rsquo;s speaking in front of me and to me.</span></p>
