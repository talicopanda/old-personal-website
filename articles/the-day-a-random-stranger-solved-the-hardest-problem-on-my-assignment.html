<p id="one-two"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a Friday night, and customarily, I had an assignment for my &ldquo;Introduction to the Theory of Computation&rdquo; class that prevented me from making any plans for the night. The whole problem set was only 4 questions long, but trust me, that is long enough. Typically, the difficulty of each problem increases as the assignment progresses, being the first problem a </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">warm up<sup class="gray"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the last one the hardest of them all. Thankfully, I was prepared for that hit and I had finished questions 1 to 3 priorly, leaving only the last question for the weekend . On Friday, I would say I spent my whole afternoon thinking about problem 4, trying to intuitively understand the question and sketch some ideas down on paper, but I am ashamed to say that I had made almost zero progress trying to prove the claim. After tirelessly working for no apparent progress, when the sunsetted I decided to take a breather and pump some iron<sup class="gray"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gym was completely empty when I arrived because people have better things to do on a Friday night (cof cof thanks prof). It was Leg Day in my schedule, so let the grind begin! The walk back to residence after the workout was rather painful (like on any leg day), and those are the times I regret living on the last floor of the furthest house, not to mention that it was raining that day. When I got to my residence, massive puddles prevented me from getting to my house&rsquo;s door without wet socks, so I went in through another house that connected from the inside to mine. As I walk in, I see a friend, Bryan (who studied humanities), chilling in the Common Room - a shared space with chairs, couches, games and a TV where students can socialize with their house peers. Those comfortable chairs in the room invited me for a little rest before climbing up the three sets of stairs I had left to get to my room after a leg workout. Bryan and I start talking about hour programs, and he introduces me to this guy that was sitting there the whole time named Andrew. No big deal at this point, just a friendly talk.</span></p>
<p id="three"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it was 10:30pm and I was about to go up to my room and keep working on my assignment, I saw a CompSci friend of mine, Omar, passing by the door. He sees me, and decides to sit with us for a bit as well. Like any good CS major, I explain Omar the problem I was stuck on, he sees the assignment page and says, &ldquo;[giggles] Dude, that looks impossible.&rdquo; Very motivating, right?! Nonetheless, I shared the progress I have had at that point and we discussed some possible ways to solve it. Bryan, not understanding what we are saying (humanities people, I tell ya), was out on his phone at that point, but I noticed that Andrew was paying close attention to what we were saying. After some point, as soon as Omar started giving up on the problem, Andrew began throwing some very insightful ideas into the discussion (he was a second year math major, I found later). He jumped onto the problem in a way that I would have never expected him to, and when I realized, we were talking about linear transformations in 10 dimensions. The discussion went on for quite a long time, enough to make Andrew pull out his multivariable calculus notes for more ideas. I was truly amazed by that guy&rsquo;s willpower to solve a random problem from a complete stranger at 11pm on Friday night just for the sake of problem-solving (how nerdier can this be?<sup class="gray"><a href="#3">3</a></sup></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">). No matter what, though, I was loving it because any help was appreciated. After a solid hour and deep mathematical discussions, we came across the solution to the problem, which was actually stupidly easy in essence if you had the right idea at the right time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was probably the most unexpectedly random thing that happened to my university career. There were so many variables and unexpected things that happened that day for the culmination be so successful. Beginning with the gym, if my legs weren&rsquo;t sore from the workout, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have stopped before going up given that I had multiple assignments to finish. If Bryan wasn&rsquo;t there to pull me in, I would also have not stopped by. Andrew did not even live in that house, and, to this day, I don&rsquo;t know what he was doing there at that time. If Omar hadn&rsquo;t passed by, I would never be talking about that problem to my humanities friend because&hellip; what is the point either way? So yes, sometimes you just have to go with the flow, even if you have to solve a hardass problem for your math class.&nbsp;</span></p>
